        "text": "Preface \nOrigin of This Text \nThis text has evolved from mathematics courses in the Master of Science in \nComputational Finance (MSCF) program at Carnegie Mellon University. The \ncontent of this book has been used successfully with stndents whose math­\nematics background consists of calculus and calculus-based probability. The \ntext gives precise statements of results, plausibility arguments, and even some \nproofs, but more importantly, intuitive explanations developed and refined \nthrough classroom experience with this material are proYided. Exercises con­\nclude every chapter. Some of these extend the theory and others are drawn \nfrom practical problems in quantitative finance. \nThe first three chapters of Volume I have been used in a half-semester \ncourse in the MSCF program. The full Volume I has been used in a full­\nsemester course in the Carnegie Mellon Bachelor's program in Computational \nFinance. Volume II was developed to support three half-semester courses in \nthe MSCF program. \nDedication \nSince its inception in 1994, the Carnegie Mellon Master's program in Compu­\ntational Finance has graduated hundreds of students. These people, who have \ncome from a variety of educational and professional backgrounds, have been \na joy to teach. They have been eager to learn, asking questions that stimu­\nlated thinking, working hard to understand the material both theoretically \nand practically, and often requesting the inclusion of additional topics. Many \ncame from the finance industry, and were gracious in sharing their knowledge \nin ways that enhanced the classroom experience for all. \nThis text and my own store of knowledge have benefited greatly from \ninteractions with the MSCF students, and I continue to learn from the MSCF \n",

        "text": "Introduction \nBackground \nBy awarding Harry Markowitz, William Sharpe, and Merton Miller the 1990 \nNobel Prize in Economics, the Nobel Prize Committee brought to worldwide \nattention the fact that the previous forty years had seen the emergence of \na new scientific discipline, the \"theory of finance.\" This theory attempts to \nunderstand how financial markets work, how to make them more efficient, and \nhow they should be regulated. It explains and enhances the important role \nthese markets play in capital allocation and risk reduction to facilitate eco­\nnomic activity. Without losing its application to practical aspects of trading \nand regulation, the theory of finance has become increasingly mathematical, \nto the point that problems in finance are now driving research in mathematics. \nHarry Markowitz's 1952 Ph.D. thesis Portfolio Selection laid the ground­\nwork for the mathematical theory of finance. Markowitz developed a notion \nof mean return and covariances for common stocks that allowed him to quan­\ntify the concept of \"diversification\" in a market. He showed how to compute \nthe mean return and variance for a given portfolio and argued that investors \nshould hold only those portfolios whose variance is minimal among all portfo­\nlios with a given mean return. Although the language of finance now involves \nstochastic (Ito) calculus, management of risk in a quantifiable manner is the \nunderlying theme of the modern theory and practice of quantitative finance. \nIn 1969, Robert Merton introduced stochastic calculus into the study of \nfinance. Merton was motivated by the desire to understand how prices are \nset in financial markets, which is the classical economics question of \"equi­\nlibrium,\" and in later papers he used the machinery of stochastic calculus to \nbegin investigation of this issue. \nAt the same time as Merton's work and with Merton's assistance, Fis­\ncher Black and Myron Scholes were developing their celebrated option pricing \nformula. This work won the 1997 Nobel Prize in Economics. It provided a \nsatisfying solution to an important practical problem, that of finding a fair \nprice for a European call option (i.e., the right to buy one share of a given \n",

        "text": "XII \nIntroduction \nstock at a specified price and time). In the period 1979-1983, Harrison, Kreps, \nand Pliska used the general theory of continuous-time stochastic processes to \nput the Black-Scholes option-pricing formula on a solid theoretical basis, and, \nas a result, showed how to price numerous other \"derivative\"' securities. \nMany of the theoretical developments in finance have found immediate \napplication in financial markets. To understand how they are applied, we \ndigress for a moment on the role of financial institutions. A principal function \nof a nation's financial institutions is to act as a risk-reducing intermediary \namong customers engaged in production. For example, the insurance industry \npools premiums of many customers and must pay off only the few who actually \nincur losses. But. risk arises in situations for which pooled-premium insurance \nis unavailable. For instance, as a hedge against higher fuel costs, an airline \nmay want to buy a security whose value will rise if oil prices rise. But who \nwants to sell such a security? The role of a financial institution is to design \nsuch a security, determine a \"fair\" price for it, and sell it to airlines. The \nsecurity thus sold is usually \"derivative\" (i.e., its value is based on the value \nof other, identified securities). \"Fair\" in this context means that the financial \ninstitution earns just enough from selling the security to enable it to trade \nin other securities whose relation with oil prices is such that, if oil prices do \nindeed rise, the firm can pay off its increased obligation to the airlines. An \n\"efficient\" market is one in which risk-hedging securities are widely available \nat \"fair\" prices. \nThe Black-Scholes option pricing formula provided. for the first time, a \ntheoretical method of fairly pricing a risk-hedging security. If an investment \nbank offers a derivative security at a price that is higher than \"fair,\" it may be \nunderbid. If it offers the security at less than the \"fair\" price, it runs the risk of \nsubstantial loss. This makes the bank reluctant to offer many of the derivative \nsecurities that would contribute to market efficiency. In particular, the bank \nonly wants to offer derivative securities whose \"fair\" price can be determined \nin advance. Furthermore, if the bank sells such a security, it must then address \nthe hedging problem: how should it manage the risk associated with its new \nposition? The mathematical theory growing out of the Black-Scholes option \npricing formula provides solutions for both the pricing and hedging problems. \nIt thus has enabled the creation of a host of specialized derivative securities. \nThis theory is the subject of this text. \nRelationship between Volumes I and II \nVolume II treats the continuous-time theory of stochastic calculus within the \ncontext of finance applications. The presentation of this theory is the raison \nd'etre of this work. Volume II includes a self-contained treatment of the prob­\nability theory needed for stochastic calculus, including Brownian motion and \nits properties. \n",

        "text": "Introduction \nXIII \nVolume I presents many of the same finance applications, but within the \nsimpler context of the discrete-time binomial model. It prepares the reader \nfor Volume II by treating several fundamental concepts, including martin­\ngales, Markov processes, change of measure and risk-neutral pricing in this \nless technical setting. However, Volume II has a self-contained treatment of \nthese topics, and strictly speaking, it is not necessary to read Volume I before \nreading Volume II. It is helpful in that the difficult concepts of Volume II are \nfirst seen in a simpler context in Volume I. \nIn the Carnegie Mellon Master's program in Computational Finance, the \ncourse based on Volume I is a prerequisite for the courses based on Volume \nII. However, graduate students in computer science, finance, mathematics, \nphysics and statistics frequently take the courses based on Volume II without \nfirst taking the course based on Volume I. \nThe reader who begins with Volume II may use Volume I as a reference. As \nseveral concepts are presented in Volume II, reference is made to the analogous \nconcepts in Volume I. The reader can at that point choose to read only Volume \nII or to refer to Volume I for a discussion of the concept at hand in a more \ntransparent setting. \nSummary of Volume I \nVolume I presents the binomial asset pricing model. Although this model is \ninteresting in its own right, and is often the paradigm of practice, here it is \nused primarily as a vehicle for introducing in a simple setting the concepts \nneeded for the continuous-time theory of Volume II. \nChapter 1, The Binomial No-Arbitrage Pricing Model, presents the no­\narbitrage method of option pricing in a binomial model. The mathematics is \nsimple, but the profound concept of risk-neutral pricing introduced here is \nnot. Chapter 2, Probability Theory on Coin Toss Space, formalizes the results \nof Chapter 1, using the notions of martingales and Markov processes. This \nchapter culminates with the risk-neutral pricing formula for European deriva­\ntive securities. The tools used to derive this formula are not really required for \nthe derivation in the binomial model, but we need these concepts in Volume II \nand therefore develop them in the simpler discrete-time setting of Volume I. \nChapter 3, State Pr-ices, discusses the change of measure associated with risk­\nneutral pricing of European derivative securities, again as a warm-up exercise \nfor change of measure in continuous-time models. An interesting application \ndeveloped here is to solve the problem of optimal (in the sense of expected \nutility maximization) investment in a binomial model. The ideas of Chapters \n1 to 3 are essential to understanding the methodology of modern quantitative \nfinance. They are developed again in Chapters 4 and 5 of Volume II. \nThe remaining three chapters of Volume I treat more specialized con­\ncepts. Chapter 4, American Derivative Securities, considers derivative secu­\nrities whose owner can choose the exercise time. This topic is revisited in \n",

The analogous reflec­\ntion principle for Brownian motion plays a prominent role in the derivation of \npricing formulas for exotic options in Chapter 7 of Volume II. Finally, Chap­\nter 6, Interest-Rate-Dependent Assets, considers models with random interest \nrates, examining the difference between forward and futures prices and intro­\nducing the concept of a forward measure. Forward and futures prices reappear \nat the end of Chapter 5 of Volume II. Forward measures for continuous-time \nmodels are developed in Chapter 9 of Volume II and used to create forward \nLIBOR models for interest rate movements in Chapter 10 of Volume II. \nSummary of Volume II \nChapter 1, General Probability Theory, and Chapter 2. Information and Con­\nditioning, of Volume II lay the measure-theoretic foundation for probability \ntheory required for a treatment of continuous-time models. Chapter I presents \nprobability spaces, Lebesgue integrals, and change of measure. Independence, \nconditional expectations, and properties of conditional expectations are intro­\nduced in Chapter 2. These chapters are used extensively throughout the text, \nbut some readers. especially those with expo.'lure to probability theory, may \nchoose to skip this material at the outset., referring to it as needed. \nChapter 3, Brownian Motion, introduces Brownian motion and its proper­\nties. The most important of these for stochastic calculus is quadratic variation, \npresented in Section 3.4. All of this material is needed in order to proceed, \nexcept Sections 3.6 and 3.7. which are used only in Chapter 7, Exotic Options \nand Chapter 8, Early Exercise. \nThe core of Volume II is Chapter 4. Stochastic Calculus. Here the Ito \nintegral is constructed and Ito's formula (called the ltO-Doeblin formula in \nthis text) is developed. Several consequences of the lt6-Doeblin formula are \nworked out. One of these is the characterization of Brownian motion in terms \nof its quadratic variation (Levy's theorem) and another is the Black-Scholes \nequation for a European call price (called the Black-Scholes-Merton equation \nin this text). The only material which the reader may omit is Section 4. 7, \nBrownian Br·id_qe. This topic is included because of its importance in Monte \nCarlo simulation, but it is not used elsewhere in the t!'xt. \nChapter 5, Risk-Neutral Pricing, st.at!'s and proves Girsanov's Theorem, \nwhich underlies change of measure. This permits a systematic treatment of \nrisk-neutral pricing and the Fundamental Theorems of Asset Pricing (Section \n5.4). Section 5.5.

In this chapter, we introduce this tool \nfor the first purpose, and we take up the second in Chapter 2. In this section, \nwe consider the simplest binomial model, the one with only one period. This \nis generalized to the more realistic multiperiod binomial model in the next \nϧϨ. \n. \nFor the general one-period model of Figure 1.1.1, we call the beginning of \nthe period time zero and the end of the period time one. At time zero, we have \na stock whose price per share we denote by So, a positive quantity known at \ntime zero. At time one, the price per share of this stock will be one of two \npositive values, which we denote S1(H) and S1(T), the H and T standing \nfor head and tail, respectively. Thus, we are imagining that a coin is tossed, \nand the outcome of the coin toss determines the price at time one. We do not \nassume this coin is fair (i.e., the probability of hea.d need not be one-half). \nWe assume only that the probability of hea.d, which we call p, is positive, and \nthe probability of tail, which is q = 1 - p, is also positive. \n/ \nSt(H) = uSo \nSo \n~ \nSt(T) = dSo \nFig. 1.1.1.

We shall \nrefer to any quantity not known at time zero as random because it depends \non the random experiment of tossing a coin. \nWe introduce the two positive numbers \nd= S1(T)_ \nSo \n(1.1.1) \nWe assume that d < u: if we instead had d > u, we may achieve d < u by \nrelabeling the sides of our coin. If d = u, the stock price at time one is not \nreally random and the model is uninteresting. We refer to u as the up factor \nand d as the down factor. It is intuitively helpful to think of u as greater than \none and to think of d as Jess than one, and hence the names up factor and \ndown factor, but the mathematics we develop here does not require that these \ninequalities hold. \nWe introduce also an interest rate 1\". One dollar invested in the money \nmarket at time zero will yield 1 + r dollars at time one. Conversely, one dollar \nborrowed from the money market at time zero will result in a debt of 1 + r \nat time one. In particular, the interest rate for borrowing is the same as the \ninterest rate for investing. It is almost always true that r l 0, and this is \nthe case to keep in mind. However, the mathematics we develop requires only \nthat r > -1. \nAn essential feature of an efficient market is that if a trading strategy can \nturn nothing into something, then it must also run the risk of loss. Otherwise, \nthere would be an arbitrage. More specifically. we define arbitrage as a trading \nstrategy that begins with no money. has zero probability of losing money, \nand has a positive probability of making money. A mathematical model that \nadmits arbitrage cannot be used for analysis. Wealth can be generated from \nnothing in such a model, and the questions one would want the model to \nilluminate are provided with paradoxical answers by the model. Real markets \nsometimes exhibit arbitrage. but this is necessarily fleeting; as soon as someone \ndiscovers it, trading takes places that removes it. \nIn the one-period binomial model. to rule out arbitrage we must assume \n0 < d < 1 + 1\" < 1/. \n( 1.1 .2) \nThe inequality d > 0 follows from the positivity of the stock prices and was \nalready assumed. The two other inequalities in ( 1 . 1 .2) follow from the absence \nof arbitrage, as we now explain. If d l 1 + r, one could begin with zero wealth \nand at time zero borrow from the money market in order to buy stock. Even \nin the worst case of a tail on the coin toss, the stock at time one will be worth \nenough to pay off the money market debt and has a positive probability of \nbeing worth strictly more since u > d ȇ 1 + r. This provides an arbitrage. \nOn the other hand, if 1t ::; 1 + 1\", one could sell the stock short and invest the \nproceeds in the money market. EVPn in the best case for the stock, the cost of \n",

This again provides an arbitrage. \nWe have argued in the preceding paragraph that if there is to be no arbi­\ntrage in the market with the stock and the money market account, then we \nmust have (1.1.2). The converse of this is also true. If (1.1.2) holds, then there \nis no arbitrage. See Exercise 1.1. \nIt is common to have d = ğ, and this will be the case in many of our \nexamples. However, for the binomial asset-pricing model to make sense, we \nonly need to assume ( 1.1. 2). \nOf course, stock price movements are much more complicated than indi­\ncated by the binomial asset-pricing model. We consider this simple model for \nthree reasons. First of all, within this model, the concept of arbitrage pric­\ning and its relation to risk-neutral pricing is clearly illuminated. Secondly, \nthe model is used in practice because, with a sufficient number of periods, \nit provides a reasonably good, computationally tractable approximation to \ncontinuous-time models. Finally, within the binomial asset-pricing model, we \ncan develop the theory of conditional expectations and martingales, which lies \nat the heart of continuous-time models. \nLet us now consider a European call option, which confers on its owner \nthe right but not the obligation to buy one share of the stock at time one for \nthe strike price K. The interesting case, which we shall assume here, is that \n81 (T) < K < 81 (H). If we get a tail on the toss, the option expires worthless. \nIf we get a head on the coin toss, the option can be e:r:ercised and yields a \nprofit of 81 (H)-K. We summarize this situation by saying that the option at \ntime one is worth (81 -K)+, where the notation (···)+ indicates that we take \nthe maximum of the expression in parentheses and zero. Here we follow the \nusual custom in probability of omitting the argument of the random variable \n81. The fundamental question of option pricing is how much the option is \nworth at time zero before we know whether the coin toss results in head or \ntail. \nThe arbitrage pricing theory approach to the option-pricing problem is to \nreplicate the option by trading in the stock and money markets. We illustrate \nthis with an example, and then we return to the general one-period binomial \nmodel. \nExample 1 .1. 1. For the particular one-period model of Figure 1.1.2, let S(O) = \n4, u = 2, d = /. and r = l· Then St (H) = 8 and St(T) = 2. Suppose the \nstrike price of the European call option is K = 5. Suppose further that we \nbegin with an initial wealth X0 = 1.20 and buy Llo = / shares of stock at \ntime zero. Since stock costs 4 per share at time zero, we must use our initial \nwealth X0 = 1.20 and borrow an additional 0.80 to do this. This leaves us \nwith a cash position Xo- LloSo = -0.80 (i.e., a debt of 0.80 to the money \nmarket). At time one, our cash position will be (1 + r)(X0- Ll0S0) = -1 \n",

In \nparticular, if the coin toss results in a head, the value of our portfolio of stock \nand money market account at time one will be \n1 \nXt(H) = 2st(H) + (1 + r)(X0- LloSo) = 3; \nif the coin toss results in a tail, the value of our portfolio of stock and money \nmarket account at time one will be \n1 \nXt(T) = 2sl (T) + (1 + r)(X0- LloSo) = 0. \nIn either case. the value of the portfolio agrees with the value of the option \nat time one, which is either (St(H)- 5)+ = 3 or (S1(T)- 5)+ = 0. We have \nreplicated the option by trading in the stock and money markets. \nThe initial wealth 1.20 needed to set up the replicating portfolio described \nabove is the no-arbitrage price of the option at time zero. If one could sell \nthe option for more than this, say, for 1.21, then the seller could invest the \nexcess 0.01 in the money market and use the remaining 1.20 to replicate the \noption. At time one, the seller would be able to pay off the option, regardless \nof how the coin tossing turned out, and still have the 0.0125 resulting from \nthe money market investment of the excess 0.01. This is an arbitrage because \nthe seller of the option needs no money initially, and without risk of loss has \n0.0125 at time one. On the other hand, if one c:oulrl buy the option above \nfor less than 1.20, say, for 1. 19, then one should buy the option and set up \nthe reverse of the replicating trading strategy described above.

In either case, the buyer of the option has a net zero \nposition at time one, plus the separate money market account in which 0.01 \nwas invested at time zero. Again, there is an arbitrage. \nWe have shown that in the market with the stock, the money market, and \nthe option, there is an arbitrage unless the time-zero price of the option is \n1 .20. If the time-zero price of the option is 1.20, then there is no arbitrage \n(see Exercise 1. 2). \n0 \nThe argument in the example above depends on several assumptions. The \nprincipal ones are: \n• \nshares of stock can be subdivided for sale or purchase, \n• \nthe interest rate for investing is the same as the interest rate for borrowing, \n• \nthe purchase price of stock is the same as the selling price (i.e., there is \nzero bid-ask spread), \n• \nat any time, the stock can take only two possible values in the next period. \nAll these assumptions except the last also underlie the Black-Scholes-Merton \noption-pricing formula. The first of these assumptions is essentially satisfied \nin practice because option pricing and hedging (replication) typically involve \nlots of options. If we had considered 100 options rather than one option in \nExample 1 . 1 . 1 ,  we would have hedged the short position by buying ..10 = 50 \nshares of stock rather than ..10 = / of a share. The second assumption is close \nto being true for large institutions. The third assumption is not satisfied in \npractice. Sometimes the bid-ask spread can be ignored because not too much \ntrading is taking place. In other situations, this departure of the model from \nreality becomes a serious issue. In the Black-Scholes-Merton model, the fourth \nassumption is replaced by the assumption that the stock price is a geometric \nBrownian motion. Empirical studies of stock price returns have consistently \nshown this not to be the case. Once again, the departure of the model from \nreality can be significant in some situations, but in other situations the model \nworks remarkably well. We shall develop a modeling framework that extends \nfar beyond the geometric Brownian motion assumption, a framework that \nincludes many of the more sophisticated models that are not tied to this \nassumption. \nIn the general one-period model, we define a derivative security to be a \nsecurity that pays some amount V1 (H) at time one if the coin toss results \nin head and pays a possibly different amount V1 (T) at time one if the coin \ntoss results in tail. A European call option is a particular kind of derivative \nsecurity. Another is the European put option, which pays off (K - Sl)+ at \ntime one, where K is a constant. A third is a forward contract, whose value \nat time one is S1 - K. \nTo determine the price V0 at time zero for a derivative security, we replicate \nit as in Example 1 .1 .1 .  Suppose we begin with wealth X0 and buy ..10 shares \nof stock at time zero, leaving us with a cash position X0- ..1080. The value \nof our portfolio of stock and money market account at time one is \n",

The derivative security that pays V1 \nat time one should be priced at \nV0 = -\n1- [PV1(H) + qVJ(T)] \n1+r \n(1.1.10} \nat time zero. This price permits the seller to hedge the short position in the \nclaim. This price does not introduce an arbitrage when the derivative security \nis added to the market comprising the stock and money market account; any \nother time-zero price would introduce an arbitrage. \nAlthough we have determined the no-arbitrage price of a derivative secu­\nrity by setting up a hedge for a short position in the security, one could just \nas well consider the hedge for a long position. An agent with a long position \nowns an asset having a certain value, and the agent may wish to set up a \nhedge to protect against loss of that value. This is how practitioners think \nabout hedging. The number of shares of the underlying stock held by a long \nposition hedge is the negative of the number determined by (1.1.9). Exercises \n1.6 and 1. 7 consider this is more detail. \nThe numbers p and q given by (1.1.8) are both positive because of the \nno-arbitrage condition (1.1.2}, and they sum to one. For this reason, we can \nregard them as probabilities of head and tail, respectivdy. They are not the \nactual probabilities, which we call p and q, but rather the so-called risk-neutral \nprobabilities. Under the actual probabilities, the average rate of growth of the \nstock is typically strictly greater than the rate of growth of an investment in \nthe money market; otherwise, no one would want to incur the risk associated \nwith investing in the stock. Thus, p and q = 1 - p should satisfy \n1 \nSo< -\n1 \n- [pS 1 (H ) +qSJ(T)], \n+ r  \nwhereas fj and ii satisfy (1.1.6}. H the average rate of growth of the stock were \nexactly the same as the rate of growth of the money market investment, then \ninvestors must be neutral about risk-they do not require compensation for \nassuming it, nor are they willing to pay extra for it. This is simply not the case, \nand hence p and ii cannot be the actual probabilities. They are only numbers \nthat assist us in the solution of the two equations (1.1.3} and (1.1.4} in the \ntwo unknowns Xo and L\\o. They assist us by making the term multiplying the \nunknown L\\o in (1.1.5) drop out. In fact, because they are chosen to make the \nmean rate of growth of the stock appear to equal the rate of growth of the \nmoney market account, they make the mean rate of growth of any portfolio \nof stock and money market account appear to equal the rate of growth of the \nmoney market asset. If we want to construct a portfolio whose value at time \none is V1, then its value at time zero must be given by (1.1. 7}, so that its \nmean rate of growth under the risk-neutral probabilities is the rate of growth \nof the money market investment. \nThe concluding equation (1.1.10) for the time-zero price V0 of the deriva­\ntive security V1 is called the risk-neutral pricing formula for the one-period \n",

Equation (1.2.10) gives \nthe value the replicating portfolio should have at time one if the stock goes \ndown between times zero and one. We define this quantity to be the price of \nthe option at time one if the first coin toss results in tail, and we denote it by \nV1 (T). We have just shown that \n(1.2.11) \nwhich is another instance of the risk-neutral pricing formula. This formula \nis analogous to formula (1.1.10) but postponed by one period. The first two \nequations, (1.2.5) and (1.2.6), lead in a similar way to the formulas \n(1.2.12) \nand X1 (H) = V1 (H), where V1 (H) is the price of the option at time one if \nthe first toss results in head, defined by \n(1.2.13) \nThis is again analogous to formula (1.1.10), postponed by one period. Finally, \nwe plug the values XI( H) = VI (H) and X1 (T) = V1(T) into the two equations \nimplicit in (1.2.1). The solution of these equations for L10 and V0 is the same \nas the solution of (1.1.3) and (1.1.4) and results again in (1.1.9) and (1.1.10). \nTo recap, we have three stochastic processes, (L10, L11 ), (X0, XM, X2), and \n(V0, VI, V2). By stochastic process, we mean a sequence of random variables \nindexed by time. These quantities are random because they depend on the \ncoin tosses; indeed, the subscript on each variable indieates the number of \ncoin tosses on which it depends. If we begin with any initial wealth X0 and \nspecify values for L10, Lli(H), and Lli (T), then we can compute the value \nof the portfolio that holds the number of shares of stock indicated by these \nspecifications and finances this by borrowing or investing in the money market \nas necessary. Indeed, the value of this portfolio is defined mcursively, beginning \nwith X0, via the wealth equation \n(1.2.14) \nOne might regard this as a contingent equation; it defines random variables, \nand actual values of these random variables are not resolved until the out­\ncomes of the coin tossing are revealed. Nonetheless, already at time zero this \nequation permits us to compute what the value of the portfolio will be at \nevery subsequent time under every coin-toss scenario. \nFor a derivative security expiring at time two, the random variable V2 is \ncontractually specified in a way that is contingent upon the coin tossing (e.g., \nif the coin tossing results in WIW2, so the stock price at time two is S2(wiw2), \n",

Continuing this process, the agent can be sure to have a portfolio \nworth V3 at time three, no matter how the coin tossing turns out. \n0 \n1.3 Computational Considerations \nThe amount of computation required by a naive implementation of the deriva­\ntive security pricing algorithm given in Theorem 1.2.2 grows exponentially \nwith the number of periods. The binomial models used in practice often have \n100 or more periods, and there are 2100 Ȫ 1030 possible outcomes for a se­\nquence of 100 coin tosses. An algorithm that begins by tabulating 2100 values \nfor V100 is not computationally practical. \nFortunately, the algorithm given in Theorem 1.2.2 can usually be organized \nin a computationally efficient manner. We illustrate this with two examples. \nExample 1.3. 1. In the model with So = 4, u = 2, d = 4 and r = ! , consider \nthe problem of pricing a European put with strike price K = 5, expiring at \ntime three. The risk-neutral probabilities are p = 4, ij = Ğ. The stock process \nis shown in Figure 1.2.2. The payoff of the option, given by V3 = (5-S3)+ , \ncan be tabulated as \nV3(HHH) = 0, \nV3(HHT) = V1(HTH) = V3(THH) = 0 \nV3(HTT) = V3(THT) = V3(TTH) = 3, \nV3(TTT) = 4.50. \nThere are 23 = 8 entries in this table, but an obvious simplification is possible. \nLet us denote by v3(s) the payoff of the option at time three when the stock \nprice at time three is s. Whereas V3 has the sequence of three coin tosses as \nits argument, the argument of v3 is a stock price. At time three there are only \nfour possible stock prices, and we can tabulate the relevant values of v3 as \nVJ(32) = 0, v3(8) = 0, v3(2) = 3, v3(.50) =, 4.50. \n",

They have the property that, at any time, the price of the stock is the \ndiscounted risk-neutral average of its two possible prices at the next time: \nSn(WI . . .  Wn) = -1- [fiSn+1 (w1 . . .  WnH) + ii.Sn+l (w1 . . .  WnT)] . \n1 + r \nIn other woʛds, under the risk-neutral probabilities, the mean rate of return for \nthe stock is r, the same as the rate of return for the money market. Therefore, \nif these probabilities actually governed the coin tossing (in fact, they do not), \nthen an agent trading in the money market account and stock would have \nbefore him two opportunities, both of which provide the same mean rate of \nreturn. Consequently, no matter how he invests, the mean rate of return for \nhis portfolio would also be r. In particular, if it is time N - 1 and he wants \nhis portfolio value to be VN(w1 . . .

One can ask whether such an \nargument can result in a valid conclusion. It does result in a valid conclusion \nfor the following reason. When hedging \na short position in \na derivative security, \nwe want the hedge to give us a portfolio that agrees with the payoff of the \nderivative security regardless of the coin tossing. In other words, the hedge \nmust work on all stock price paths. If a path is possible (i.e., has positive \nprobability), we want the hedge to work along that path. The actual value \nof the probability is irrelevant. We find these hedges by solving a system \nof equations along the paths, a system of the form (1.2.2)-(1.2.3), (1.2.5)­\n(1.2.8). There are no probabilities in this system. Introducing the risk-neutral \nprobabilities allows us to argue as above and find a solution to the system. \nIntroducing any other probabilities would not allow such a.n argument because \nonly the risk-neutral probabilities allow us to state that no matter how the \nagent invests, the mean rate of return for his portfolio is r.

No \narbitrage pricing was fully developed in continuous-time models by Harrison \nand Kreps [17] and Harrison and Pliska [18]. These authors introduced martin­\ngales (Sections 2.4 iu this text and Section 2.3 in Volume II) and risk-neutral \npricing. The binomial model is due to Cox, Ross. Rubinstein [11); a good \nreference is [12). The binomial model is useful in its own right, and as Cox \nct a!. showed, one can rederive the Black-Scholes-1\\lerton formula as a limit \nof the binomial model (see Theorem 3.2.2 in Chapter 3 of Volume II for the \nlog-normality of the stock price obtained in the limit of the binomial model.) \n1. 6 Exercises \nExercise 1.1.

We should instead verify that the \nmathematics and our intuition agrf'f': othf'rwise, either our intuition is wrong \nor our model is inadequate. If our intuition and the mathematics of a model \ndo not agree. we should seek a reconciliation before proceeding. In the case of \n(2.1.3). we set out to build a model in which the probability of a head on each \ntoss is p. we proposed doing this by ddining the probahilit ies of thf' elf'rnents \nof f? by (2.1.2). and we further defined tlw probahilit.v of an event (subsf't \nof f?) to he the sum of the probabilities of the elements in the event. These \ndefinitions force us to carry out tlw computation (2.1.3) as we have done, and \nwe need to do this computation in order to check that it gets the expected \nanswer. Otherwise, we would have to rethink our mathematical model for the \ncoin tossing. \nWe generalize slightly the situation just described, first by allowing f? to he \nany finite set, and second by a.llowing some elements in f? to have probability \nzero. These generalizations lead to the following definition. \nDefinition 2.1.1. A finite probability space rm1si.sts of a sample space f? and \na probability measnre IP'.

The set \nf? is the set of all possible outcomes of the experiment, IP'(w) is the probability \nthat the particular outcome u.: occurs. and IP'(A) is the probahilitȐ· that the \noutcome that occurs is in the set A .  If IP'(A )  = 0, then the outcome of the \nexperiment is sure not to be in A if IP'(A) = 1. then the outcome is sure to be \nin A. Because of (2.1.4), we have the equation \nIP'(f?) = 1. \n(2.1.6) \ni.e .. the outcome that occurs is snre to he in the set Jl.

This gives rise to \nthe concept of a random variable. \nDefinition 2.2.1. Let (!7, IP) be a finite probability space. A random variable \nis a real-valued function defined on !7. (We sometimes al.so permit a random \nvariable to take the values +oo and -oo.) \nExample 2.2.2 (Stock prices). Recall the space J] of three independent coin­\ntosses (2.1.1). As in Figure 1.2.2 of Chapter 1, let us define stock prices by \nthe formulas \nif WI = w2 = H, \nif WI f. W2, \nif WI = W2 = T, \nif WI = W2 = WJ = H, \nif there are two heads and one tail, \nif there is one head and two tails, \nif WI = W2 = W:J = T. \nHere we have written the arguments of So, SI ' s2, and s3 as WIW2WJ, even \nthough some of these random variables do not depend on all the coin tosses. In \nparticular, S0 is actually not random because it takes the value 4, regardless \nof how the coin tosses turn out; such a random variable is sometimes called a \ndegenerate random variable. \n0 \nIt is customary to write the argument of random variables as w, even \nwhen w is a sequence such as w = wiw2w3. We shall use these two notations \ninterchangeably. It is even more common to write random variables without \nany arguments; we shall switch to that practice presently, writing S3, for \nexample, rather than S3(wiw2w3) or S3(w). \nAccording to Definition 2.2.1, a random variable is a function that maps \na sample space J] to the real numbers. The distribution of a random variable \nis a specification of the probabilities that the random variable takes various \nvalues. A random variable is not a distribution, and a distribution is not a \nrandom variable. This is an important point when we later switch between \nthe actual probability measure, which one would estimate from historical data, \nand the risk-neutral probability measure.

When dealing with convex functions, \nwe have the following inequality. \nTheorem 2.2.5 (Jensen's inequality) .  Let X be a random variable on a \nfinite pmbability space. and let <p(.r) be a convex function of a dummy variable \nx. Then \nIE[<p(X)] 2: <p(IEX). \nPROOF: We first argue that a convex function is the maximum o f  all linear \nfunctions that lie below it; i.e., for every x E R \n<p(x) = max{ t(x) ; f is linear and f(y) ::; <P(Y) for ally E JR}. \n(2.2.1) \nSince we are only considering linear functions that lie below rp, it is clear that \nrp(x) 2: max{l'(x);l' is linear and t(y) ::; <p(y) for all y E JR}. \nOn the other hand, let x be an arbitrary point in JR. Because <P is convex, \nthere is always a linear function f that lies below <p and for which 'f'(X) = f(x) \nfor this particular x. This is called a support line of <p at x (see Figure 2.2.1 ) . \nTherefore, \n<p(x) S: max{l'(x) ; l'  is linear and f(y) S: rp(y) for all y E JR}. \nThis establishes (2.2.1). Now let f be a linear function lying below rp. We have \nIE [rp(X)] 2: IE [l'(X)] \n= t(IEX). \nSince this inequality holds for every linear function l' lying below rp, we may \ntake the maximum on the right-hand side over all such l' and obtain \nIE[<p(X)] 2: max{l'(IEX);l' is linear and f(y) S: 'P(Y) for all y E JR} \n= rp(IEX). \nOne consequence of .Jensen's inequality is that \n0 \n\\Ve can also obtain this particular consequence of .Jensen's inequality from the \nformula \n",

        "text": "38 \n2 Probability Theory on Coin Toss Space \nA similar equation would hold at all other nodes in the tree, and therefore we \nwould have a martingale under these probabilities. \nA martingale has no tendency to rise or fall since the average of its next \nperiod values is always its value at the current time. Stock prices have a \ntenrlenry to rise and, indPPn. shoulrl risP on avPrage faster than the money \nmarket in order to compensate investors for their inherent risk. In Figure 2.3. 1 \nmore realistic choices for p and q are p = \u0004 and q = 1· \\Vith these choices, \nwe have \nIE,[S,+d = ĐS, \nat every node in the tree (i.e., 011 average, the next. period stock price is 50% \nhigher than the current stock price). This growth rate exceeds the 25% interest \nrate we have been using in this model, as it should. In particular, with p = \u0004. \nq = t, and r = ę, the discounted stock price has a tendency to rise. Note \nthat when r = j-. we have 1lr = \f . so the discounted stock price at time n is \n( Ě)\" S,. We compute \n[\n( 4) \"+1 \nl \nIE, \n5 \nSn+I = ( 4) \" + 1  \n( 4) \" \n4 \n3 \n(4)\" \n5 \n1En[S'n+d = 5 \n· 5 · 2 · Sn \u0015 \n5 \nS,. \nThe discounted stock price is a submartingale under the actual probabilities \np = \u0004, q = t. This is typically the case in real markets. \nThe risk-neutral probabilities, on the other hand. are chosen to make the \ndiscounted stock price be a martingale. In Figure 2.3.1 with p = ij = e. one \ncan check that the martingale equation \n-\n[\n( 4) ll+ l  l ( 4) \" \nIE, \n5 \nSn+I = \n5 \nS, \n(2.4.5) \nholds at every node. The following theorem shows that this example is repre­\nsentative. \nTheorem 2.4.4. Consider the general binomial model with 0 < d < 1 +r < u. \nLet the risk-neutral probabilities be given by \nl + r - d  \np =  ---=-­\nu - d  \n' \nu - l - 1' \nij =  ---\nu - d  \nThen, under the risk-neutral measure, the discounted stock price is a martin­\ngale, i.e., equation (2.4. 1} holds at every time n and for every sequence of \ncoin tosses. \nWe give two proofs of this theorem, an elementary one, which does not \nrely on Theorem 2.3.2, and a deeper one, which does rely on Theorem 2.3.2. \nThe second proof will later be adapted to continuous-time models. \nNote in Theorem 2.4.4 that the stork does not pay a dividend. For a \ndividPnd-paying stock, the situation is described in Exercise 2.10. \n",

In particular, since a stock generally has a \nhigher average rate of growth than the money market, the investor can achieve \na rate of growth higher than the interest rate by taking long positions in the \nstock. huleed, by borrowing from the money market, the investor can achieve \nan arbitrarily high average rate of growth. Of course, such leveraged positions \nare also extremely risky. \nOn the other hand, if we want to know the average rate of growth of the \ninvestor's wealth under the risk-neutral probabilities, the portfolio the investor \nuses is irrelevant. Under the risk-neutral probabilities, the average rate of \ngrowth of the stock is equal to the interest rate. No matter how the investor \ndivides his wealth between the stock and the money market account. he will \nachieve an average rate of growth equal to the interest rate.

Under the conditions of Theorem 2.4.5, we have \n-\nXn \nE( \n) = X0, n= 0, 1, . . . , N. \n1 + r n \n(2.4.8) \nPROOF: The corollary follows from the fact that the expected value of a \nmartingale cannot change with time and so must always be equal to the time­\nzero value of the martingale (see Remark 2.4.3). Applying this fact to the \nP-martingale (lġ)\" , n = 0, 1, . . .  , N, we obtain (2.4.8). \n0 \nTheorem 2.4.5 and its corollary have two important consequences. The \nfirst is that there can be no arbitrage in the binomial model. If there were \nan arbitrage, we could begin with X0 = 0 and find a portfolio process whose \ncorresponding wealth process X 1 ,  X 2 ,  . . . , X N satisfied X N ( w) e 0 for all coin \ntoss sequences w and XN(w) > 0 for at least one coin toss sequence w. But \nthen we would have EX0 = 0 and E (l!;')N > 0, which violates Corollary 2.4.6. \nIn general, if we can find a risk-neutral measure in a model (i.e., a measure \nthat agrees with the actual probability measure about which price paths have \nzero probability, and under which the discounted prices of all primary assets \nare martingales), then there is no arbitrage in the model. This is sometimes \ncalled the First Fundamental Theorem of Asset Pricing. The essence of its \nproof is contained in the preceding paragraph: under a risk-neutral measure, \nthe discounted wealth process has constant expectation. so it cannot begin \nat zero and later be strictly positive with positive probability unless it also \nhas a positive probability of being strictly negative. The First Fundamental \nTheorem of Asset Pricing will prove useful for ruling out arbitrage in term­\nstructure models later on and thereby lead to the Heath-Jarrow-Morton no­\narbitrage condition on forward rates. \nThe other consequence of Theorem 2.4.5 is the following version of the \nrisk-neutml pricing formula. Let VN be a random variable (derivative security \npaying off at time N) depending on the first N coin tosses. We know from \nTheorem 1.2.2 of Chapter 1 that there is an initial wealth X0 and a replicating \nportfolio process Llo, . . .  , LlN-I that generates a wealth process X1, . . .  , XN \nsatisfying X N = V N, no matter how the coin tossing t-urns out. Because ( 1 !)\" , \nn = 0, 1, . . .  , N, is a martingale, the \"multistep ahead\" property of Remark \n2.4.2 implies \n(1 :)n = En [(I :)N] = En [(I ė:)N] · \n(2.4.9) \nAccording to Definition 1.2.3 of Chapter 1 ,  we define the price of the derivative \nsecurity at time n to be Xn and denote this price by the symbol Vn. Thus, \n(2.4.9) may be rewritten as \n(2.4.10) \nor, equivalently, \n",

In particu­\nlar, when the Markov process Xo. X 1 ,  . . . , X N is the stock price itself, we get \nthe algorithm (2.5.2). \nThe same idea can be used for multidimensional Markov processes under \nii. A case of this was Example 1.3.2 of Section 1.3, in which the payoff of a \nderivative security was V3 = M3 -S3, the difference between the stock price \nat time three and its maximum between times zero and three. Because only \nthe stock price and its maximum-to-date appear in the payoff, we can use \nthe two-dimensional Markov process { (S,., M,); n = 0, 1, 2, 3} to treat this \nproblem, which was done implicitly in that example. \nHere we generalize Example 1.3.2 to an N-period binomial model with \na derivative security whose payoff at time N is a function VN(SN,MN) of \nthe stock price and the maximum stock price. (We do not mean that VN \nis necessarily a function of both S N and M N but rather that these are the \nonly random variables on which VN depends. For example, we could have \nVN = (MN - K)+. Even though the stock price does not appear in this \nparticular VN, we would need it to execut.e the pricing algorithm (2.5.9) below \nbecause the maximum-to-date process is not Markov by itself.) According to \nthe \"multi-step-head\" Markov property, for any n between zero and N, there \nis a (nonrandom) function v,.(s, m) such that the price of the option at time \nn is \n- [VN(SN,MN)] \nV,, = v,(Sn, M,) = IE,. \n(1 + r)N-n \n. \nWe can use the Independence Lemma 2.5.3 to derive an algorithm for com­\nputing the functions v,..

One is the actual prob­\nability measure, by which we mean the one that we seek by empirical es­\ntimation of the model parameters. The other is the risk-neutral probability \nmeasure, under which the discounted prices of assets are martingales. These \ntwo probability measures give different weights to the asset-price paths in \nthe model. They agree, however, on which price paths are possible (i.e., which \npaths have positive probability of occurring); they disagree only on what these \npositive probabilities are. The actual probabilities are the \"right\" ones. The \nrisk-neutral probabilities are a fictitious but helpful construct because they \nallow us to neatly summarize the result of solving systems of equations (se, \ne.g., the system {1.1.3), {1.1.4) of Chapter 1, which leads t.o the formula (1.1.7) \nof that chapter). \nLet us more generally consider a finite sample space n on which we have \ntwo probability measures IP' and ii. Let us assume that. P and ii both give \npositive probability to every element of n, so we can form the quotient \nP(w) \nZ(w) = IP'(w) ' \n(3.1.1) \nBecause it depends on the outcome w of a random experiment, Z is a random \nvariable. It is called the Radon-Nikodym derivative of ii with respect to IP', \nalthough in this context of a finite sample space n, it is really a quotient rather \nthan a derivative. The random variable Z has three important properties, \nwhich we state as a theorem. \nTheorem 3.1.1. Let P and IP' be probability measures on a finite sample space \nf1, a.Ô.Õume that P(w) > 0 and IP'(w) > 0 for every w Ϧ f1, and define the \nrandom variable Z by {3. 1.1).

It is natural to expect \nthe price to take into account the probability that w will occur, and therefore \nwe have arranged the formulas so that JP>(w) is one of the factors in the state \nprice. However, these two factors alone cannot tell the whole story because \nthey do not account for risk. If we were to use these terms alone, and take \nthe time-zero price of a derivative security to be E (lrJR ,  then the time­\nzero price of an asset would depend only on its expected return under the \nactual probability measure. In fact, the price of an asset depends on both its \nexpected return and the risk it presents. The remaining term appearing in \nthe state price corresponding to w, Z(w), accounts for risk. For example, in \n(3.1.5) we see that Z discounts the importance of the stock price paths that \nend above the initial stock price So = 4 because Z < 1 whenever there are \ntwo or three heads in the three coin tosses, but Z inflates the importance of \nthe stock price paths that end below the initial stock price. The effect of this \nis to make holding the stock appear less favorable than one would infer from \nsimply computing E [ ( Ď) 3 S3], its discounted expected value at time three. \nThe state price ((w)JP>(w) tells us the time-zero price of a. contmct that \npays 1 at time N if and only if w occurs. The state price density 0z_;N tells \nus the time-zero price of this contract per unit of actual probability. For this \nreason, we call it a density. \nOf course, most contracts make payoffs for several different values of w, \nand these payoffs are not all necessarily 1. Such a contract can be regarded \nas a portfolio of simple contracts, each of which pays off 1 if and only if some \nparticular w occurs, and their prices can be computed by summing up the \nprices of these components. To see this, recall from (2.4.11) of Chapter 2 \nthe risk-neutral pricing formula V0 = iE (JrlN for the time-zero price of an \narbitrary derivative security paying VN at time N. In terms of the state price \ndensity, this can be rewritten simply as \nVo = E[(VNJ = L VN (w)((w)JP>(w). \n(3.1.10) \nwen \nEquation (3.1.7) is a special case of this, where the ((t.t.•) term is separated \ninto its factors (lrl\" and Z(w). \n3.2 Radon-Nikodym Derivative Process \nIn the previous section, we considered the Radon-Nikodym derivative of the \nrisk-neutral probability measure with respect to the actual probability mea­\nsure in an N-period binomial model. This random variable Z depends on the \nN coin tosses in the model. To get related random variables that depend on \nfewer coin tosses, we can estimate Z based on the informntion at time n < N. \n",

The mathematical \nmethodology, however, is broadly applicable. In this section, we show how it \ncan be brought to bear on a problem at the heart of the capital asset pricing \nmodel, that of maximizing the expected utility obtained from investment. \nIn no-arbitrage pricing, there are two probability measures, the actual \nprobability measure and the risk-neutral measure.

In asset management, one cares about \nthe trade-off of risk and actual (rather than risk-neutral) expected return. \nIn risk management, one cares about the actual probability of a catastrophic \nevent. In both of these situations, however, there is a role for the risk-neutral \nprobability measure. For risk management, the portfolio whose risk is being \nassessed normally contains derivative securities whose theoretical prices under \nvarious scenarios must be computed using the risk-neutral mea.c;ure. For asset \nmanagement, the risk-neutral measure enters in the manner set forth in this \nsection. \nWe now set out the capital asset pricing problem. By a utility function \nwe shall mean a nondecreasing, concave function defined on the set of real \nnumbers. This function may take the value -oo, but not the value +oo. A \ncommon utility function is In x, which is normally defined only for x > 0. We \nadopt the convention that In x = -oo for x $ 0, so this is defined for every \nx E IR and is nondecreasing and concave. Recall that a function U is concave \nif \nU(ax + (1 - a)y) ? aU(x) + (1 - a)U(y) \nfor every x.y E IR, a E (0, 1). \n(3.3.1) \nWe say U is strictly concave if the inequality in (3.3.1) is strict whenever \nx =/= y, and in fact we shall assume that U is strictly concave everywhere it is \nfinite. A whole class of utility functions can be obtained by first choosing a \nnumber p < 1, p =/= 0, and another number c E IR, and defining \n{ \n! (x - c)P if x > c \np \n' \n, \nU (x) = \n0, \nif O < p < l and x = c, \nP \n-oo, \nif p < 0 and x = c, \n-oo, \nif x < c. \nFor these functions, the index of absolute risk aversion -','(;} is the hyper­\nbolic function !.=£ for :r. > c. This class of functions is called the HARA \nz-c \n(hyperbolic absolute risk aversion) class. The HARA function corresponding \nto p =  0 is \nUo(x) = { ln(x - c), čf x > c, \n-oo, \ntf x $ c. \nConcavity of utility functions is assumed in order to capture the trade­\noff between risk and return. For example, consider a gamble which pays off 1 \nwith probability . and 99 with probability .. The expected payoff is 50, but a \nrisk-averse agent would prefer to have 50 rather than the random payoff of the \ngamble. Let X denote this random payoff, i.e., !?(X = 1) = !?(X = 99) = \u0006­\nFor a concave utility function, we have from Jensen's inequality used upside \ndown (Theorem 2.2.5 of Chapter 2) that lEU( X) $ U(IEX). Indeed, if U(x) = \nIn x, then IE In X = 2.30 and In EX = 3.91. If we mod•31 agent behavior as \nmaximization of expected utility of payoff, our model would indicate that an \nagent would prefer the nonrandom payoff lEX = 50 over the random payoff X. \n",

However, this does not \naccount for the risk that the payoff is zero if \"state\" omega does not occur. \nThe creation of a state price to account for risk traces back to Arrow and \nDebreu [1]. \nThe problem of optimal investment or, more generally, optimal consump­\ntion and investment, has been the subject of a great deal of research. The \noriginal papers are Hakansson [16] for the discrete-time model and Merton \n[32], [33J, [35] for the continuous-time model. (These papers of Merton are \ncollected in [36].) The solution of the problem via the state price density pro­\ncess is due to Pliska [37] and was further developed by Cox and Huang [7), \n[8] and Karatzas, Lehoczky, and Shreve [27]. Except for [16], all these models \nare in continuous time. They have been specialized to the binomial model for \nthis text. A compilation of research along these Jines, including treatment of \nportfolio constraints and the model with different interest rates for borrowing \nand investment, is provided by Karatzas ami Shreve [28]. \n3.6 Exercises \nExercise 3.1.

        "text": "4 \nAmerican Derivative Securities . \n4.1 Introduction \nEuropean option contracts specify an expiration date, and if the option is \nto be exercised at all, the exercise must occur on the expiration date. An \noption whose owner can choose to exercise at any time up to and including \nthe expiration date is called American. Because of this early exercise feature, \nsuch an option is at least as valuable as its European counterpart. Sometimes \nthe difference in value is negligible or even zero, and then American and \nEuropean options are close or exact substitutes. We shall see in this chapter \nthat the early exercise feature for a call on a stock paying no dividend is \nworthless; American and European calls have the same price. In other cases, \nmost notably put options, the value of this early exercise feature, the so-called \nearly exercise premium, can be substantial. An intermediate option between \nAmerican and European is Bermudan, an option that permits early exercise \nbut only on a contractually specified finite set of dates. \nBecause an American option can be exercised at any time prior to its ex­\npiration, it can never be worth less than the payoff associated with immediate \nexercise. This is called the intrinsic valtLe of the option. \nIn contrast to the case for a European option, whose discounted price \nprocess is a martingale under the risk-neutral measure, the discounted price \nprocess of an American option is a supermartingale under this measure. The \nbolder of this option may fail to exercise at the optimal exercise date, and in \nthis case the option has a tendency to lose value; hence, the supermartingale \nproperty. During any period of time in which it is not optimal to exercise, \nhowever, the discounted price process behaves like a martingale. \nTo price an American option, just as with a European option, we shall \nimagine selling the option in exchange for some initial capital and then con­\nsider how to use this capital to hedge the short position in the option. In this \ncase, we need to be ready to pay off the option at all times prior to the expi­\nration date because we do not know when it will be exercised. We determine \nwhen, from our point of view, is the worst time for the owner to exercise the \n",

Indeed, if the first toss results in head. then the stock price is 51 (H) = 8 \nand the put is out of the money. If the second toss results in another head. \nthen Sz(H H) = 16. the put is still out of the money, and the owner should let \nit expire without exercising it. On the other hand, if the first toss is a head \nand the second toss is a tail. then S2(HT) = 4, the put is in the money at \ntime two. and the owner should exercise. We describe this exercise rule by the \nfollowing random variable r: \nr(H H) = oc ,  r(HT) = 2. r(TH) = 1, r(TT) = 1. \nwhich is clisplaѾ·pd in FigmP 4.3.1 .  \nDon't exercise \n/ \nr(HH) = oo  \nDon't exercise \n/ \n: \nDon't exercise \nExercise \nr(T H) = r(TT) = I \nFig. 4.3. 1 .

If she could use this exercise rule, then \nregardless of the coin tossing, she would exercise the put in the money. The \nproblem with the exercise rule p is that it cannot be implemented without \n\"insider information.\" It calls for the decision of whether or not to exercise at \ntime zero to be based on the outcome of the first coin toss. If the first coin \ntoss results in a tail, then the decision of whether or not to exercise at time \none is based on the outcome of the second coin toss. It is not a stopping time \nin the sense of Definition 4.3.1 below. \nDefinition 4.3.1. In an N -period binomial model, a stopping time is a ran­\ndom variable T that takes values 0, 1, . . . , N or oo and satisfies the condition \nthat i.f r(w1w2 . . .  WnWn+l . . .  WN) = n, then r(w1w2 . . .  WnW¬+I . . .  w­) = n for \nall w¬+I . . .  w­. \nThe condition in the definition above that if r(w1w2 . . .  WnWn+ 1 . . .  WN) = n \nthen r(w1w2 . . .  WnW¬+I . . .  w­) = n for all w¬+l . . .  w­ ensures that stopping \nis based only on available information. If stopping occurs at time n, then this \ndecision is based only on the first n coin tosses and not on the outcome of any \nsubsequent toss. \nWhenever we have a stochastic process and a stopping time, we can define \na stopped pmcess (see Figure 4.3.3). For example, let Y., be the process of \ndiscounted American put prices in Figure 4.2.3; i.e., \nYo = 1.36, \nYt (H) = 0.32, \nY1 (T) = 2.40, \nY2(HH) = 0, \nY2(HT) = Y2(TH) = 0.64, \nY2(TT) = 2.56. \n",

How­\never, if this process is stopped at the optimal exercise time, it becomes a \nmartingale. If the owner of the security permits a time to pass in which the \nsupermartingale inequality is strict, she has failed to exercise optimally. \nWe have just seen by example that we can stop a process that is not a \nmartingale and thereby obtain a martingale. Of course, if we stop a process \nthat is already a martingale, we will obtain a process that may be different but \nis still a martingale. This trivial observation is one consequence of a general \ntheorem about stopping times called the Optional Sampling Theorem. \nTheorem 4.3.2 (Optional sampling-Part I). A martingale stopped at a \nstopping time is a martingale. A supermartingale (or submartingale} stopped \nat a stopping time is a supermartingale (or submartingale, respectively). \nWe illustrate the first statement of the theorem with an example.

        "text": "4.4 General American Derivatives \n101 \n4.4 General American Derivatives \nIn this section, we introduce American derivative securities whose intrinsic \nvalue is permitted to be path-dependent. We define the price process for such \na security and develop its properties. We also show how to hedge a short \nposition in such a derivative security and study the optimal exercise time. All \nclaims made in this section are supported by mathematical proofs. \nWe work within the context of an N -period binomial model with up factor \nu, down factor d, and interest rate r satisfying the no-arbitrage condition \n0 < d < 1 + r < u .  In such a model, we define Sn to be the set of all stopping \ntimes T that take values in the set {n, n + 1 ,  . .. , N, \noo} . In particular, the set \nSo contains every stopping time. A stopping time in SN can take the value N \non some paths, the value oo on others, and can take no other value. \nDefinition 4.4.1 .  For each n, n = 0, 1, ... , N, let Gn be a random variable \ndepending on the first n coin tosses. An American derivative security with \nintrinsic value process Gn is a contract that can be exercised at any time prior \nto and including time N and, if exercised at time n, pays off Gn · We define \nthe price process Vn for this contract by the American risk-neutral pricing \nformula \nVn = max En (n{r<N} (1 \\ cT] ' \nn = 0, 1, ... 'N. \nrESn \n-\n+ r T - n \n( 4.4.1) \nThe idea behind (4.4.1) is the following. Suppose the American derivative \nsecurity is not exercised at times 0, 1, ... , n -1 and we are trying to determine \nits value at time n. At time n, the owner of the derivative can choose to exercise \nit immediately or postpone exercise to some later date. The date at which she \nexercises, if she does exercise, can depend on the path of the stock price up to \nthe exercise time but not beyond it. In other words, the exercise date will be a \nstopping time T. Since exercise was not done before time n, this stopping time \nmust be in Sn . Of course, if she never exercises ( T = oo ), then she receives zero \npayoff. The term H{r$N} appears in (4.4.1) to tell us that H{r$N} (l+rl)T n GT \nshould be replaced by zero on those paths for which T = oo. When the owner \nexercises according to a stopping time T E Sn , the value of the derivative \nto her at time n is the risk-neutral discounted expectation of its payoff. She \nshould choose T to make this as large as possible. \nOne of the immediate consequences of this definition is that \nTo see that, we take n = N in ( 4.4.1) so that it becomes \n1 \nVN = sup H{r$N} ( )T-N CT. \nrESN \n1 + r \n(4.4.2) \nA stopping time in SN takes only the values Nand oo, and for such a stopping \ntime \n",

Property (i) guarantees that if an agent does this, he \nhas hedged a short position in the derivativc security; no matter when it \nis exercised, the agent's hedging portfolio value is sufficient to pay off the \nderivative security. Thus, (i) and (ii) guarantee that the derivative security \nprice is acceptable to the seller. Condition (iii) says that the price is no higher \nthan necessary in order to be acceptable to the seller. This condition ensures \nthat the price is fair for the buyer. \nPROOF: We first establish (i).

We shall use this same idea in our study of Brownian motion. As \nin Section 5.2, we first consider a symmetric random walk, obtaining formula \n(5.2.22). The remainder of the argument to obtain Theorem 5.2.5 is the same \nas in Section 5.2. \nSuppose we toss a coin an odd number (2j - 1) of times. Some of the \npaths of the random walk wiJI reach the level 1 in the first 2j - 1 steps and \nothers will not. In the case of three tosses, there are eight possible paths and \nfive of these reach the Ievel l (se Figure 5 .3.1). Consider a path that reaches \nthe level 1 at some time 7'1 :5 2j -1. From that moment on, we can create a \n\"reflected\" path, which steps up each time the original path steps down and \nsteps down each time the original path steps up. If the original path ends \nabove 1 at the final time 2j - 1, the reflected path ends below 1, and vice \nversa. If the original path ends at 1, the reflected path does also. \nTo count the number of paths that reach the level 1 by time 2j - 1, we \ncan count the number of paths that exceed 1 at time 2j - 1, the number of \npaths that are at 1 at time 2j - 1, and the number of reflected paths that \nexceed I at time 2j- I. The reflected paths that exceed I correspond to paths \nthat reached 1 at some time prior to 2j - 1 but are below I at time 2j - I. \nIn Figure 5.3.1, there is only one path that exceeds 1 at time three: H H H. \nThere arc three paths that are at I at time three: H HT, HT H, and T H H. \nThere is one path whose reflected path exceeds 1 at time three: HTT. These \naccount for all five paths that reach level 1 by time three. \nThere are as many reflected paths that exceed 1 at time 2j - 1 as there \nare original paths that exceed 1 at time 2j - I. In Figure 5.3.1, there is one of \neach of these. Thus, to count the number of paths that reach level 1 by time \n2j - 1, we can count the paths that arc at I at time 2j - I and then add on \ntwice the number of paths that exceed 1 at time 2j - 1. ln other words, for \nthe symmetric random walk, \nIP'{TJ $ 2j - 1 }  = IP'{AI2j-I = 1 }  + 21P'{M2j-1 ¯ 3}. \nBut for the symmetric random walk, IP'{M2j-J ¯ 3} = IP'{M2i-l :5 -3}, so \nIP'{r1 $ 2j - 1} = IP'{M2j-l = l }  + IP'{M2j-l ¯ 3} + fil{M2j-l $ -3} \n= 1 - P{M2J-I = -1 }. \n",

This is not a traded instrument but rat.her a mathematical \nconcept that serves as a bridge between the discrete-time American pricing \nand hedging discussion of Chapter 4 and the continuous-time analysis for \nAmerican derivative securities in Chapter 8 of Volume II. \nWe consider a binomial model with up factor u = 2, down factor d = 4, \nand interest rate ,. = ă. For this model, the risk-neutral probabilities (se \n(1.1.8) of Chapter 1) are p = q = \f· The stock price at time n is \nSn = So · 2M\", \n(5.4.1) \nwhere Mn is the random walk of (5.1.2). Under the risk-neutral probabilities, \nMn is symmetric. \nConsider an American put with strike price /( = 4 and no expiration date. \nAt any time n, the owner of this put can exercise it, selling for $4 a share of \nstock worth $Sn. We are interested in the value of this put as a function of \nthe underlying stock price. Because there is no expiration, it is reasonable to \nexpect the value of the put to depend only on the stock price, not on time. \nSimilarly, it is reasonable to expect the optimal exercise policy to depend only \non the stock price, not on time. \nFor the moment, let us suppose that So = 4. Here are some possible \nexercise policies: \nPolicy 0: Exercise immediately. This corresponds to the stopping time r0, \nthe first time the random walk Mn reaches the level 0, which is r0 = 0.

The idea behind this principle is that there arc as many paths that \nreach the level m prior to a final time but are below m at the final time as \nthere are paths that are above m at the final time. This permits one to count \nthe paths that reach level m by the final time. The retlection principle can \nalso be used to determine the joint distribution of a random walk at some \ntime n and the maximum value it achieves at or before time n; see Exercise \n5.5. \nThe moment-generating function formula for a random walk permits us \nto evaluate the risk-neutral expected discounted payoff of a perpetual Amer­\nican put if it is exercised the first time the stock price falls to a specified \nthreshold. One can then determine the exercise threshold that maximizes the \nrisk-neutral expected discounted payoff. An example of this is worked out in \nSection 5.4. The argument that the put price found this way is indeed correct \nrelies on verifying the three properties of the price of an American derivative \nsecurity: (i) the price dominates the intrinsic value, (ii) the discounteci price is \na supermartingale under the risk-neutral measure, and (iii) the price obtained \nis the smallest possible price that satisfies (i) and (ii). These steps are carried \nout for the example in Section 5.4. \nOne can also seek the price of a perpetual American option by solving the \nBellman equation, which for the put in Section 5.4 is \n(5.4.13) \n",

The continuous-time version of this equation studied in Chap­\nter 8 of Volume II must hold for all pm;itivP values of H. In both discrete \nand continuous time, the Bellman equation can have extraneous solutions. In \ncontinuous time, one can usP boundary conditions appropriate for the option \nunder consideration to rule these out. In discrete time, one must use both the \nboundary conditions and a careful consideration of the nature of the lattice \nof possible stock prices to rule out the extraneous solutions. In particular, the \ncontinuous-time version of this equation for the general perpetual American \nput problem has a simpler solution than the discrete-time version. \n5.6 Notes \nThe solution to the perpetual American put problem considered in Section 5.4 \nwas worked out as a 1994 Carnegie Mellon Summer Undergraduate Mathemat­\nics Institute project by Irene Villegas using the method outlined in Exercise \n5.9. This is an example of an optimal stopping problem. A classical reference \nfor optimal stopping problems is Shiryaev [39]. Shiryaev, Kabanov, Kramkov, \nand l\\[elnikov [41] consider the general perpetual American put problem in a \nbinomial model, and their work is reported in Shiryaev [40]. \n5. 7 Exercises \nExercise 5.1. For the symmetric random walk, consider the first passage time \n7m to the level m .  The random variable 72 - 71 is the number of steps required \nfor the random walk to rise from level 1 to level 2, and this random variable \nhas the same distribution as 71 , the number of steps required for the random \nwalk to rise from level 0 to Ievel l. Furthermore, 72 - 71 and 7t are independent \nof one another; the latter depends only on the coin tosses 1 ,  2, . . .  , 71 , and the \nformer depends only on the coin tosses r1 + 1, Tt + 2, . . .  , T2 . \n(i) Use these facts to explain why \n!Ear2 = (!Ear' )\n2 for all a E (0, 1). \n(ii) Without using (5.2.13), explain why for any positive integer m we must \nhave \n(5.7.1 )  \n(iii) Would equation (5.7.1) still hold i f  the random walk is not symmetric? \nExplain why or why not. \nExercise 5.2 (First passage time for random walk with upward \ndrift).

        "text": "6 \nInterest-Rate-Dependent Assets \n6.1 Introduction \nIn this chapter, we develop a simple, binomial model for interest rates and \nthen examine some common assets whose value depends on interest rates. \nAssets in this class are called fixed income assets. \nThe simplest fixed income asset is a zero-coupon bond, a bond that pays a \nspecified amount (called its face value or par value) at a specified time (called \nmaturity). At times prior to maturity, the value of this asset is less than its \nface value, provided the interest rate is always greater than zero. One defines \nthe yield of the zero-coupon bond corresponding to a given maturity as the \nconstant interest rate that would be needed so that the time-zero price of the \nbond invested at time zero and allowed to accumulate at this interest rate \nwould grow to the face value of the bond at the bond's maturity. Because \nthere is theoretically a zero-coupon bond for each possible maturity, there \nis theoretically a yield corresponding to every time greater than the current \ntime, which we call 0. The yield curve is the function from the maturity \nvariable to the yield variable. One is interested in building models that not \nonly determine the yield curve at a particular time but provide a method for \nrandom evolution of the yield curve forward in time. These are called term \nstructure of interest rates models. \nThe existence of a zero-coupon bond for each maturity raises the specter \nof arbitrage. A term-structure model has numerous tradable assets-all the \nzero-coupon bonds and perhaps other fixed income assets. How can one be \nassured that one cannot within the model find an arbitrage by trading in these \ninstruments? Regardless of one's view about the existence of arbitrage in the \nreal world, it is clear that models built for pricing and hedging must not admit \narbitrage. Any question that one attempts to answer with a model permitting \narbitrage has a nonsensical answer. What is the price of an option on an \nasset? If one can begin with zero initial capital and hedge a short position \nin the option by using the arbitrage possibility within the model, one could \n",

        "text": "144 \n6 Interest-Rate-Dependent. Assets \nargue that the option price is zero. Furthermore, one cannot advance a more \nconvincing argument for any other price. \nIn this chapter, we avoid the problem of arbitrage by building the model \nunder the risk-neutral measure. In other words, we first describe the evolu­\ntion of the interest rate under the risk-neutral measure and then determine \nthe prices of zero-coupon bonds and 1111 other fixed income assetR hy using \nthe risk-neutral pricing formula. ThiR r.onstrnction guarantees that all dis­\ncounted asset prices are martingales. and so all discounted portfolio processes \nare martingales (when all coupons and other payouts of cash are reinvested in \nthe portfolio). This is Theorem 6.2.6, the main result of Section 6.2. Because a \nmartingale that begins at zero must always have expectation zero, martingale \ndiscounted portfolio processes arc inconsistent with arbitrage; t.hey cannot \nhave a positive value with positive probability at some time unless they also \nhave a negative value with positive probability at t hat time. \nModels that are built starting from the interest rate and using risk-neutral \npricing are called short-mte models. Examples of such models in continuous \ntime are the Vasicek-Hull-White model [42J. [23J, and the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross \nmodel [10]. The classical model in continuous time that begins with a de­\nscription of the random evolution of the yield curve and develops conditions \nunder which the model is arbitrage-free is due to Heath, Jarrow, and t-.•!orton \n[20]. [21]. This model might be called a whole yield model because it takes \nthe whole yield curve as a starting point. The difference between these two \nclasses of models is of fundamental practical importance. However, in a whole \nyield model, one still has an interest rate, and all the other assets are related \nto the interest. rate by the risk-neutral pricing formula. Although the interest \nrate evolution in whole yield models is generally more complex than in the \nbinomial model of this chapter, the ideas we develop here can be transferred \nto whole yield models. \nTwo common discrete-time models are Ho and Lee [22] and Black-Derman­\nToy [4J. We use the former as the basis for Example 6.4.4 and the latter as \nthe basis for Example 6.5.5. \n6.2 Binomial Model for Interest Rates \nLet [l be the set of 2N possible outcomes w1w2 . . .  WN of N tosses of a coin, and \nlet IP be a probability measure on f2 under which every sequence w1w2 . . .  WN \nhas strictly positive probability. We define an interest r-ate process to be a \nsequence of random variables \nwhere Ro is not random and, for n = 1, . . .  , N - 1, Rn depends only on the \nfirst n coin tosses w1 . . .  Wn.

We may use the property of \"taking out what is known\" (The­\norem 2.3.2{ii)) to rewrite (6.2.4) as \n(6.2.5) \nFrom this formula, we see that týe discounted bond price DnBn,m, n \n= \n0, 1, . . .  , m, is a martingale under IP'. In particular, if 0  k  n  m, then \n(6.2.5) and \"iterated conditioning\" (Theorem 2.3.2(iii)) imply \nwhich is the martingale property. Definition 6.2.4 was chosen so that dis­\ncounted zero-coupon bond prices would be martingales. \nConsider an agent who can trade in the zero-coupon bonds of every mar \nturity and in the money market. We wish to show that the wealth of such an \nagent, when discounted, constitutes a martingale. From this, we shall see that \nthere is no arbitrage in the model in which zero-coupon bond prices are defined \nby (6.2.4). In particular, let Lln,m be the number of m-maturity zero-coupon \nbonds held by the agent between times n and n + 1. Of course, we must have \nn < m since the m-maturity bond does not exist after time m. Furthermore, \nLln,m is allowed to depend on only the first n coin tosses. The agent begins \nwith a nonrandom initial wealth X0 and at each time n has wealth Xn· His \nwealth at time n + 1 is thus given by \nXn+l = Lln,n+l + t Lln,mBn+l,m + ( 1  + R.,) (xn - t Lln,mBn,m) · \nm=n+2 \nm=n+l \n(6.2.6) \nThe first term on the right-hand side of (6.2.6) is the payoff of the zero­\ncoupon bond maturing at time n +  1, multiplied by the positions taken in this \nbond at time n and held to time n + 1. The second term is the value of all \nthe zero-coupon bonds maturing at time n + 2 and later, multiplied by the \nposition taken in these bonds at time n and held to n + l. The second factor \nin the third term is the cash position taken at time n, which is the difference \nbetween the total wealth Xn of the agent and the value of all the bonds held \nafter rebalancing at time n. This is multiplied by 1 plus the interest rate that \nprevails between times n and n + 1. \nTheorem 6.2.6.

Setting the swap price \nequal to zero and solving for K, we obtain (6.3.5). \n0 \nFormula (6.3.4) for the no-arbitrage price of an m-period swap is of \ncourse also consistent with risk-neutral pricing.

Whenever such hedging portfolios can be constructed, risk-neutral \npricing is justified, and (6.3.6) is an example of this. In the remainder of \nthis section, we consider risk-neutral pricing of interest rate caps and floors, \nand although short position hedges for these instruments can usually be con­\nstructed, we do not work out the detailed assumptions that guarantee this is \npossible. Exercise 6.4 provides an example of a hedge construction. \nDefinition 6.3.8. Let rn be given, with 1 ::; rn ::; N.

Whenever the interest owed is more than K, the cap pays the difference. \nSimilarly, if one is receiving variable interest Rn_1 at each time n on an invest­\nment of 1, then owning an interest rate floor effectively provides a guaranteed \ninterest rate of at least K. WhenPver the interest received is less than K, the \nfloor pays the difference. \nNote that. \nIn other words, at each time, the payoff of a portfolio holding a swap and a \ncap is the same as the payoff of a floor. It follows that \nSwap111 + Capm = Floor111• \n(6.3.9) \nIn particular, if K is set equal to the m-period swap rate, then the cap and \nthe floor have the same initial price. \nExample 6.3. 9.

This makes the pricing of fixed \nincome derivatives difficult. \nOne way around this dilemma is to build interest rate models using forward \nmeasures rather than the risk-neutral measure. The idea is to use the term Dm \non the right-hand side of (6.4.1) as a Radon-Nikodym derivative to change to \na different measure, and provided we then compute expectations under this \ndifferent measure, the term Dm no longer appears. To make this idea precise, \nwe begin with the following definition. \nDefinition 6.4.1. Let m be fixed, with 1 $ m $ N. We define \nDm \nZm,m = --\nBo,m \nand use Zm,m to define the m-forward measure pm by the formula \njpm(w) = Zm,m(w)P(w) for all w E  Jl. \n(6.4.2) \nTo check that jpm is really a probability measure, we must verify that it \nassigns probability one to Jl. This is the case because IEZm,m = 1. Indeed, \njpm(Jl) = L jpm(w) = L Zm,m(w)P(w) == EZm,m = f-iEDm = 1, \nwen \nwen \nO,m \nwhere the last equality follows from the definition of zero-coupon bond prices \n(se (6.2.3)).

If the \naccount balance becomes too low, the broker issues a margin call, requiring \nthe agent to either deposit more money in the account or close the futures \nposition (see below). \nAn agent who holds a short futures position makes payments equal to \n(Futk+I,m -Futk.m) and agrees to sell the asset at its market price Sm at \ntime m.

Thus, it costs nothing to enter a long (or a short) \nfutures position, apart from the requirement that a margin account be set up. \nSince (6.5.1) is required to hold for all n between 0 and m - 1, the value of the \nfutures contract is zero at. all times. In particular, it costs nothing for an agent \nwho holds a long position to \"sell\" his contract (i.e., to close the position). \nAt that time, all payments (positive and negative) to the agent cease and the \nagent no longer is obligated to purchase the asset at the market price at time \nm.

The con­\ncept of forward measures, which will be revisited in Volume II in a continuous­\ntime setting, is due to Jamshidian {24] and Geman, El Karoui and Rochet {15]. \nThese measures underlie the so-called ma1·ket models, or forward LIBOR mod­\nels, of interest rates developed by Sandmann and Sondermann [38] and Brace, \nGatarek, and M usiela [6], models that are consistent with the Black caplet for­\nmula. The distinction between forward contracts and futures was pointed out \nby Margrabe [31] and Black [3]. No-arbitrage pricing of futures in a discrete­\ntime model was developed by Cox, Ingersoll, and Ross [9] and ,larrow and \nOldfield [25].
